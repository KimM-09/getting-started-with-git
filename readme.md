use 3 backticks for longer codeblocks. you can include the language for appropriate syntax hightlighting. syntax for longer codeblocks look like:

```javascript
function hello(name) {
    console.log("Hello" + name + "!")
}
```

write ordered lists by using a number followed by a period.
1. Hello
1. What's up
